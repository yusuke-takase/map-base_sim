# Map-based simulation 
This repository brings together code for performing map-based simulations with cross-linking.
The crosslink maps are generated in HDF5 format earlier by Falcons.jl, and the notebook loads them and provides classes to link them to the physical quantities of the CMB observations.

In the future, a concrete pipeline for handling Diff sistematics etc. could be implemented.
